1.11 - 2019-01-04

Known Bugs - Doing -trivia for first time will cause the question and answer to come out simultaneously if -trivia isn't done within 30 seconds of starting the bot

1.22 - 
- Added ability for streamers to make their own custom commands
- Fixed a bug which kept chatlines from saving to database
- Added an automatic unmod function (moderators who have been unmodded will be unmodded in the bot database as well (not instant))
- Added a "level" function, this level moves based on how nice viewers are being, alpha stage (looooong alpha)
- Users now are rewarded with .2 point per chatline
- Fixed a bug where -compare chatlines {username} would break the bot
- Added comparison between levels
- Added a stats command which will show past 30 days hours and chatlines in stream

1.23/1.24 - 
- Fixed bug which would not correctly check for file existence
- Added -give {username} {points}, can only be used to give points to streamer/bot so it is not abused
- Fixed bug where level wouldnt be tracked per message
- Fixed a bug where UID would be set to 0 in Hours DB
- At one point removed ability for bots to be mods, corrected that behavior (and fixed a bug associated with it)
- Updated Database interactions, now will only need one database as opposed to two
- Added scaling database transactions, the more people in the stream the longer it will go before writing to DB next
- Fixed bug where extremely large chat messages/foreign characters can break it
- ADDED streamer_prefs.txt so streamers can turn off honor, points, trivia game and guessnumber game (trivia and guessnumber turned off, honor and points just don't save to database, so if viewers do the command when it's "off" they may still be able to see some temporary data which will be deleted when stream is turned off)
- Added a max length for joinmessages of 240 characters

1.24.2 -

- Fixed a trivia bug where an answer would be shown as "wrong" in chat even after already answered
